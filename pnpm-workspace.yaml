# Krepis ADaaS Platform - pnpm Workspace Configuration
# ============================================================================
#
# 🎯 Purpose:
# Defines the package locations for the pnpm monorepo.
# All packages under these directories are treated as workspace packages.
#
# 🏛️ ADaaS Vision Alignment:
# - apps/: BaaS applications (Backend as a Service)
# - packages/: @krepis/* core and adapter libraries
# - native/: Rust-based high-performance native modules
# ============================================================================

packages:
  # Core framework packages
  - 'packages/*'
  
  # BaaS Applications
  - 'apps/*'
  
  # Exclude native Rust modules from pnpm
  # They are managed by Cargo workspaces
  # - '!native/*'
